# ResearchMind AI - Multi-Agent Research Assistant

> A production-quality Python application that searches for research papers, generates intelligent summaries, extracts key topics, identifies emerging research trends, and exports professional PDF reports.

## 🎯 Overview

**ResearchMind AI** is an intelligent research analysis system powered by Google's Gemini API. It automates the research paper discovery and analysis workflow through a coordinated multi-agent architecture:

1. **Search Agent** - Discovers research papers on a given topic
2. **Summary Agent** - Generates detailed summaries of papers
3. **Topic Agent** - Extracts key research topics and themes
4. **Trend Agent** - Identifies emerging research trends
5. **PDF Generator** - Exports professional analysis reports

The system provides both a **web interface** (Streamlit) and **command-line interface** (CLI) for flexible usage.

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 Research paper discovery
* 📝 AI-generated paper summaries
* 🏷️ Topic extraction from papers
* 📈 Emerging trend identification
* 📄 Professional PDF report generation
* 🕘 Search history tracking
* 🎨 Modern Streamlit dashboard

## 🔄 API Response Handling

ResearchMind AI is built to handle common API and data issues gracefully.

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No papers found | Shows a user-friendly message and stops analysis safely |
| Topic extraction fails | Continues with summaries and report generation |
| Only one paper available | Skips trend analysis and informs the user |
| Invalid/Incomplete paper data | Skips the affected paper and continues |
| Empty or malformed API response | Logs the issue and handles it safely |
| API quota exceeded | Displays an error message without crashing |
| PDF generation failure | Preserves analysis results and reports the error |

### Key Features
- Graceful error handling
- Batch API processing for efficiency
- User-friendly warnings
- Comprehensive logging
